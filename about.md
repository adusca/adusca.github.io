Hi! I'm Alice. I studied Mathematics in college. I was doing a Master's degree in Mathematical Economics before getting serious about programming. I ended up doing a Master's degree in Applied Math instead, were I could use my new-found passion for programming. I'm interested in learning more about almost everything. "Explique-me" is portuguese for "Explain to me".

### More Information

I started this blog to share my experiences at the Recurse Center, then it became a place for me to share what I was learning at Mozilla, both as a volunteer and as an intern. After I joined Google I stoped posting, but I'm still here.
