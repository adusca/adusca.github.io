Thanks to Mozilla and Outreachy, I was able to spend one week visiting
Mozilla's Toronto office and it was awesome. My mentor, armenzg,
really went out of his way to make me feel welcomed. It was a great
way to feel like I'm part of the Mozilla community.

armenzg introduced me to Toronto mozillians so I could learn more
about what is going on in the organization: ekyle gave me an 
[ActiveData](http://activedata.allizom.org/tools/query.html) tour (so much data to play with!), mconley explained the 
[e10s](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis)
project to me (this time it is going to happen!), secretrobotron talked with
me about community building (I want to get more involved in the
Brazilian Mozilla community).

Thursday I went with the other interns and their mentors to a
real-life Escape-the-room game. It was pretty fun and a great chance
to meet people from a lot of different teams.

The best part of the whole week was Friday. armenzg invited
me, wlach, ekyle and rwood to a work-from-his-house day and it was
very pleasant. It was a great ending for an amazing week!
