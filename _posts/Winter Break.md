title: Winter Break
---

It's Winter break now at Hacker School, but the week was quite productive. I worked on two projects.
## Ray-tracer

My first project of the week was a [ray-tracer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_%28graphics%29).

## My first Mozilla bug

I've always wanted to contribute to open-source and now I finally feel ready. I searched for simple Python bugs with no owners on [Bugs Ahoy](http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?py=1&unowned=1&simple=1) and decided to go for [Bug 1059125](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052195), because it was a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) bug and I've finished doing the very well explained [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/) just last week. The actual bug fix involved about 3 lines of codes, but I ended up reading Django's source code to learn how things work, it was a great experience. After submitting my pull request I was asked to add test cases covering my changes.
