title: Acting upon Pulse messages
tags: [mozilla]
---

[Pulse Actions](https://github.com/adusca/pulse_actions) is a service that listens to retrigger/cancel messages on `exchange/treeherder/v1/job-actions` and acts upon them using [Mozilla CI Tools](https://github.com/armenzg/mozilla_ci_tools).

The project was deployed to Heroku today in dry-run mode, i.e., instead of actually making retrigger/cancel requests, Pulse Actions is just logging the requests it would have made.

If this experiment works, it might be possible for Treeherder to use the service for retrigger/cancel requests. That would eliminate the need for users signed in with Persona to enter LDAP credentials to make TH requests ([bug 1077053](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1077053)) and would also open a lot of new possibilities (e.g. adding a `backfill` button to TH using mozci).

This project's progress is being tracked in [bug 1168148](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1168148).
