I started my [Outreachy](http://outreachy.org/) internship with
Mozilla on May 25th, working with
[mozci](http://mozilla-ci-tools.readthedocs.org/en/master/project_definition.html). A
lot happened in the first five weeks:

- We added more tests to mozci
- We started [Pulse Actions](http://explique.me/Pulse)
- We fixed some bugs in mozci
- We discovered
[permission issues](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1168148#c23)
that put the original plan of doing retrigger/cancel requests through Pulse Actions on hold
- We added new features to mozci
- We decided to invest on using Pulse Actions to add more functionality to Treeherder instead
- We improved mozci's performance

Part of the application process was writing a project proposal. Mozci
was about 2 months old at the time and so much changed since then that
strictly following the original proposal would have been a bad
idea.

Our current plan for the rest of my internship is to focus on using
Pulse Actions to add new functionality to Treeherder, but a lot can
happen until then (for example, we depend a lot on feedback from the
sheriffs to guide us). I'm not nervous because I know I can count with
the help of people from Outreachy, the
[Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com) and the A-team, especially my
mentor Armen who has been awesome since I started contributing to
mozci a long long time ago (four whole months!).
